📚 Book Buddy: Collaborative Filtering RecommenderA full-stack Machine Learning application that suggests books based on user behavior patterns using Item-Based Collaborative Filtering. The system is trained on the classic "Book-Crossing" dataset and deployed via a Streamlit web interface.🚀 Live Demo[Insert your Streamlit Cloud Link Here]🛠️ The Tech StackLanguage: Python 3.xData Manipulation: Pandas, NumPyMachine Learning: Scikit-Learn (K-Nearest Neighbors)Web Framework: StreamlitMathematical Approach: Cosine Similarity🧠 How it Works1. Data Filtering & SparsityTo ensure high-quality recommendations, the raw dataset was filtered to remove "noise":Users: Only users with more than 200 ratings were included to ensure we captured established reading patterns.Books: Only books with more than 50 ratings were included to ensure statistical significance.2. The Vector SpaceEach book is represented as a high-dimensional vector in a "User-Rating Space." If we have 899 unique users, each book is a vector in an 899-dimensional space where each dimension is the rating given by a specific user.3. Cosine Similarity & KNNThe core engine uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Unlike Euclidean distance (which measures the straight-line distance between points), we use Cosine Similarity.Cosine Similarity measures the angle between vectors. This is superior for recommendation systems because it focuses on the pattern of ratings rather than the absolute number of ratings.The formula for the cosine of the angle $\theta$ between two vectors $A$ and $B$ is:$$\text{similarity} = \cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{\|\mathbf{A}\| \|\mathbf{B}\|}$$💻 Installation & Local UsageClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/book-recommender.git
